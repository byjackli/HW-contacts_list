# Contacts List App
Contacts List is a take-home assignment for [redacted] company. The target is to spend 3 days designing, implementing, and testing said project. Due to the nature of this project, specific requirements will not be listed unless approved.

Prototyping will be done on Figma, implementation will be done with ReactJS, and end-to-end testing will be done manually.


## Documentation
Code is loosely documented, as I opt for descriptive function and component names.

See [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) for daily progress reports.
